* hyperkitty.el

An emacs package for reading public mailing list archives hosted via
[[https://hyperkitty.readthedocs.io][Hyperkitty]].

Currently, this is a WIP and can only fetch and list emails in a new buffer.

* Usage

In order to use this library, first install it by cloning the git repo:

#+begin_src bash
$ git clone https://github.com/maxking/hyperkitty.el
#+end_src

Then, add the clone directory to the ~load-path~:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/hyperkitty.el")
#+end_src

There are a couple of dependencies that you'd need to install before using the
package (I haven't figured out packaging yet!). You need to install:

- [[https://github.com/tkf/emacs-request][emacs-request]]
- [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/introduction-to-ido-mode][ido-mode]]

After that, add this to your emacs init file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'hyperkitty)
(setq hyperkitty-mlists
      (list
       (cons "test@mailman3.org" "https://lists.mailman3.org/archives")))
#+end_src

Then, you need to only start using by running ~M-x hyperkitty~.
